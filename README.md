# WeatherApp

# The Goal
In this project I learnt about building a wether app and get introduced to Application Proragramming Interfaces (APIs) to grab live data from the internet.  

# What I created
I created a dark-mode enabled weather app.  I  can check the weather for the current location based on the GPS Data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.

# What I Learned

Search for any City and get its current Weather Data.      
Creating a Dark Mode enabled app anD use vector assets.    
Learn to use the UITextField to get user input.                    
Learn about Swift Protocols and the Delegate Design Pattern.          
Working with APIs by fetching Weather Data using URLSession (making HTTP requests with URLSession)                               
Once we got the weather data back we parse it from a  JSON format to a swift object using JSONDecoder.
